# Glean Me Sinatra App

## Sinatra portfolio project
This is a CRUD app built on Sinatra. Users can enter locations where they found 'free food' that could be available for the public to eat/harvest. This way we can share the resources and distribute them to those who need them. Users need to create an account in order to add or edit locations (and only locations they entered).

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.
Everything should be set up.

## Install instructions

Run `bundle install` to install all required gems. Then run `shotgun`
and click on a link provided in your terminal.
